      <h3>Meme filtering tool</h3>
      <p>
        This project was dream come true for me. As far as I can remember I could never tag and search in my memes
        effectively.
        I have written a series of <a
          href="https://medium.com/@peterhatvani/creating-a-meme-stash-with-state-of-the-art-machine-learning-3bb87263101">articles</a>
        on the basis I have identified and sorted the images. I have used Svelte for the frontend, the current demo is
        hosted on firebase. The meat of the project is done in python.
