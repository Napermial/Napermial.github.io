                <h2>Pars pro toto Focus in English It-Clefts</h2>

                <p class="pub-abstract">The syntax/meaning mismatch in pars pro toto (PPT) focus constructions poses an
                    apparent challenge to
                    grammatical approaches that map specifc syntactic positions to particular information structural
                    functions.
                    In PPT focus, some constituent X (e.g. the object) is placed in a position systematically associated
                    with focus
                    interpretation, yet a distinct constituent Y that properly contains X in the canonical, basic form
                    of the same
                    sentence (e.g. the VP), is assigned focus interpretation. In all examples of PPT focus previously
                    noted in a range
                    of languages, X originates inside Y and it is raised out of its basic position by movement. If this
                    is generally
                    the case, then some account of the mismatch that is based on the syntactic reconstruction of the
                    movement
                    of X may be feasible. The issue that the present talk addresses is whether PPT focus is licensed
                    only if X and
                    Y are related by a syntactic movement dependency in this way. To address this question, we conducted
                    an
                    acceptability rating study of the interpretation of English it-clefts, a focus-marking construction
                    in which the
                    pivot is not related to the cleft clause by syntactic movement (Frascarelli & Ramaglia 2013,
                    Haegeman et al.
                    2014). Our results show that a sentence-wide broad focus interpretation is available in it-cleft
                    sentences, which
                    suggests that a movement relation is not necessary for a PPT focus interpretation to arise. This
                    outcome points
                    to the conclusion that the challenge that the mismatch in PPT constructions poses at the
                    syntax/meaning
                    interface may run deeper than previously assumed.</p>
