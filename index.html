        <h2>📜 About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello I'm Péter a second year university student at Pázmány Péter Catholic Univesity. In this programme we learn not just classical linguisics but language technology as well. During this course I could create a machine leaning model that would generate a poem or verify a scientific claim from a corpus of abstracts.
